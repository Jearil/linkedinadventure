It&apos;s a new day, much like any other day at Frobozz Industries. It&apos;s 8:55am and you are mildly delirious from lack of sleep. You spent the previous evening waiting in line to get a new phone, which is quite possibly the most interesting thing to have happened since the last time you got a new phone. You idly wonder if you can convince your boss to expense it as you glance down at it in your hand, feeling very clever for getting the LinkedIn app so you can have a reason to use it at work. Or, at least you can pretend to be while you&apos;re surreptitiously tending your virtual garden during the staff meeting.

Fancy Hallway
This hallway is really fancy. You&apos;re not sure you&apos;re dressed appropriately for such a hallway. It appears that more craftsmanship went into the floor trim than was applied to the entire building that you grew up in. Pictures on the wall feature people and still life. The area is bathed in a soft yellow light. The hallway continues to the east.

The Office of the CFO
This office is large and spacious. The carpet is a deep red, while the walls are a pale tan. Soft yellow light emmits from the fixtures overhead. It features a broad mahogany desk with a slim silver computer off to one side. A series of filing cabinets lines the wall.
