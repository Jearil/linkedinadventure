Enlightenment
Clarity fills your mind as you realize your sole purpose in life is to create an interactive fiction (just like this!) about LinkedIn. You&apos;re really not sure where it will go or what it will contain but you feel compelled to pour your life essense into this project. You imagine the rewards will be astounding. The feeling of pure joy of having reached this conclusion is enough to bring a tear to your eye. You try to hold it back, yet fail.

 To the east is a Vahalla where you can meet your fate. To the West is a pit of snakes. (You probably don&apos;t want to go there).

Enlightenment
Clarity fills your mind as you realize your sole purpose in life is to create an interactive fiction (just like this!) about LinkedIn. You&apos;re really not sure where it will go or what it will contain but you feel compelled to pour your life essense into this project. You imagine the rewards will be astounding. The feeling of pure joy of having reached this conclusion is enough to bring a tear to your eye. You try to hold it back, yet fail.

 To the east is a Vahalla where you can meet your fate. To the West is a pit of snakes. (You probably don&apos;t want to go there).
