Reception Area
You are standing in the middle of a large room with vaulted ceilings.  The walls are painted LinkedIn blue and decorated with a multitude of posters.  There is a water cooler in the corner and a few chairs strewn about.  The receptionist is sitting at a large desk and is working on her computer.  On the desk there is a webcam and a bowl of candy.

On the Large Desk are a Webcam and a Bowl of candy (in which is a piece of candy).

You can also see a Receptionist and a Glass Door here.

Enlightenment
Clarity fills your mind as you realize your sole purpose in life is to create an interactive fiction (just like this!) about LinkedIn. You&apos;re really not sure where it will go or what it will contain but you feel compelled to pour your life essense into this project. You imagine the rewards will be astounding. The feeling of pure joy of having reached this conclusion is enough to bring a tear to your eye. You try to hold it back, yet fail.

 To the east is a Vahalla where you can meet your fate. To the West is a pit of snakes. (You probably don&apos;t want to go there).
